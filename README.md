# Advent of Code

My solutions for the challenges posted on the [Advent of Code
website](https://adventofcode.com/).  I'd like to emphasize that these were
completed with an eye towards speed of completing the program and tend to
ignore software engineering best practices, readability, maintainability, etc.

Here are my stats for the years I have participated.  I have a leaderboard
with a close group of friends, which is what the "score" column refers to.

year | Days Attempted | Num Stars | Score |
-----|----------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
2023 | 13 | 23 | 135 (2nd) |
2022 | 8 | 15 | 69 (4th) |
2021 | 10 | 20 | 116 (3rd) |
2020 | 13 | 26 | 115 (2nd) |
2019 | 10 | 20 | 114 (3rd) |
